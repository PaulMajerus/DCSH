The DCSH package is designed to provide users of DCSH data with a comprehensive toolkit that facilitates the understanding, processing, and analysis of these data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DCSH like so:

``` r
remotes::github("PaulMajerus/DCSH")
```
Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
